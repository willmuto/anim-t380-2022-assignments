# Assignment 3

Using a file naming convention (either the one in this lecture or one you design), write a Maya script that increments the file version by one and saves the file with the updated name. For example:
`bunny.model.wmuto.1.ma` gets saved as `bunny.model.wmuto.2.ma`

* `cmds.file` is your friend again here!
* You can update the filename however you like. You can use the split method from this lecture; or you could try using regex groups (https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.Match.groupdict) for a challenge
* To make it even easier to use, you can add it as a shelf button (https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2020/ENU/Maya-Customizing/files/GUID-C693E884-F81A-4858-B5D6-3856EB8F394E-htm.html)
