# Assignment 5

This assignment is similar to assignment 1; this time, instead of running in Maya standalone, create a simple [PySide](https://srinikom.github.io/pyside-docs/PySide/QtGui/index.html) user interface to demonstrate one of the commands in the the [Maya python API](https://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/2022/CHS/Maya-Tech-Docs/CommandsPython/).

Refer to python/template.py as a starting point. The assignment can be as simple as adding geometry to the scene, but if you are interested in a challenge, try adding additional widgets like text input or combo boxes to add additional user input.
